## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at **VIT Bhopal University**, passionate about building clean, efficient software and exploring the fascinating world of data. I believe great code is like a good recipe — it needs the right ingredients, the right structure, and a little creativity to come together perfectly.

When I'm not pushing commits, you'll probably find me buried in a book, dissecting a movie plot way more than necessary, or experimenting in the kitchen (my code compiles faster than my pasta cooks, usually).

## Career Goals

I'm working towards a career as a **Software Engineer**, with a strong interest in also diving deep into **Data Science**. My goal is to sit at the intersection of the two — building intelligent, data-driven applications that solve real problems.

In the short term, I'm focused on:
- Strengthening my full-stack development skills with React & MongoDB
- Exploring machine learning and data analysis with Python
- Contributing to open-source projects and collaborative builds

Long term? I want to be the kind of engineer who doesn't just write code, but designs systems that genuinely make a difference.

## Fun Facts

- I treat cooking the same way I treat debugging — confidently add things, hope for the best, and Google when it goes wrong. It almost always goes wrong.
- I can recommend you a movie for literally any mood, situation, or existential crisis. I've also definitely over-analyzed the cinematography of films I watched at 2 AM. No regrets.
- I read books the way I write code — multiple things open at once, tabs everywhere, and a vague sense that I'll finish all of them eventually.
